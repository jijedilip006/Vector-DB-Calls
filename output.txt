2 How is the Maritime Setup used in JIVIEWS?
JIVIEWS is a powerful workforce management solution, whereby on one hand it helps the organization to manage employees and their attendance and availability and on the other hand, helps to manage the crane and equipment and their availability
There are five constituents of the maritime setup of the system:
- Berth setup
- Location definitions
- Crane setup
- Equipment types
- Equipment setup

============================================================
CHUNK 5
============================================================
2.1 How is Berth Setup used in JIVIEWS?
- In JIVIEWS, Berth information is used to plan and schedule the vessel's arrival and departure. the system lets us know how to optimize the berth and crane allocation and minimize the overall service time for vessels and improve the utilization of terminal assets.

============================================================
CHUNK 6

2 How is the Maritime Setup used in JIVIEWS?
JIVIEWS is a powerful workforce management solution, whereby on one hand it helps the organization to manage employees and their attendance and availability and on the other hand, helps to manage the crane and equipment and their availability
There are five constituents of the maritime setup of the system:
- Berth setup
- Location definitions
- Crane setup
- Equipment types
- Equipment setup

============================================================
CHUNK 5
============================================================
2.1 How is Berth Setup used in JIVIEWS?
- In JIVIEWS, Berth information is used to plan and schedule the vessel's arrival and departure. the system lets us know how to optimize the berth and crane allocation and minimize the overall service time for vessels and improve the utilization of terminal assets.

============================================================
CHUNK 6
============================================================
2.1.1 How to configure Berth Setup in JIVIEWS?
